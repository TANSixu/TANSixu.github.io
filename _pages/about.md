Hello, world!
I am a ~~first-year~~ ~~second-year~~ third-year Ph.D. student at UC Riverside, fortunately advised by Prof. [Zhaowei Tan](https://cs.ucr.edu/~ztan/). I obtained my bachelor's degree from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). During my undergraduate study, I worked with the [Mobile Computing and Smart Sensing LAB](https://jinzhang-sustech.github.io/lab/) led by Prof. [Jin Zhang](https://jinzhang-sustech.github.io/). My research interest lies in networked system, edge computing, and IoT. Connecting everything is cool, init?
